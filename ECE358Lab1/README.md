### Building
With `clang` installed with C++17 support, simply run `make` in the project directory.

### Running
Run `make run`
This will build and run the executable. The executable outputs data used in answering each question.

### Graphing
Outputs are seperated by question headers and can be pasted into a blank file in a text editor of your choice. Save the file as a .csv to graph in Microsoft Excel or equivalent programs.
